//  This code was orginally borrowed from: https://crunchybagel.com/working-with-hex-colors-in-swift-3/
//  It has been modified from its orginial form but not to an appriaciable extent
//
//  Purpose: This file creates an extension to the UIColor class which will allow hexidecimal color strings to be converted into a UIColor. The format that is being looked for is #xxxxxx where x are the numbers.
